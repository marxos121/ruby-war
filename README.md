# Ruby war

Ruby War is an implementation of the classic card game *War*... written in Ruby. It supports two types of players (Human and AI) and allows up to 12 players to compete in a single game. Cards are implemented using the Flyweight pattern as a programming exercise. Additionally, the game state can be saved and resumed at a later time.
